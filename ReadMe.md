# ESP8266 LPG Leakage Email Sender
**Monitors the LPG sensor output 500 times and takes the average of the sampling to reduce reading noise,and if the value is greater than the threshold value, it sends email to the recipient.**  

### Before uploading the code make to sure to change in the Gsender header file:
```cpp
const int SMTP_PORT = 465;// STMP port change it if you use other smtp  
const char* SMTP_SERVER = "smtp.gmail.com";// gmail smtp server change if you use other smtp  
const char* EMAILBASE64_LOGIN = "YOUR EMAIL ID ENCODED WITH BASE64";// your email must me encoded with base64  
const char* EMAILBASE64_PASSWORD = "YOUR PASSWORD ENCODED WITH BASE64";// your password must be encoded with base64  
const char* FROM = "youremail@gmail.com";//your email address with encoding
```
### Change these lines as per your need:
```cpp
const int sensorPin = A0; //connect sensor A0 output to this pin  
const char *ssid = "xxxxxxxxx";    // WIFI network name  
const char *password = "xxxxxxxx"; // WIFI network password  
uint8_t connection_state = 0;       // Connected to WIFI or not  
uint8_t nSampling = 500;            //change as per your need  
uint16_t threshold = 200;           // change as per your need
```
